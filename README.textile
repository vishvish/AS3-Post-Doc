h2. Forked from "as3dac":http://code.google.com/p/as3dac/

as3dac was a cool project, but it's not had any love in a while, and it wasn't quite providing the exact formatting I wanted. So I've updated it here.

h3.

I like to use this recursively, as suggested on the as3dac site. I have implemented this into my ZSH shell with a plugin. It looks like this:

@function as3postdoc-recursive {
	find $@ -name "*.as" | while read as3file
	do
	  as3postdoc -a "$USER" -e "$EMAIL" -c "$as3file" -o "$as3file"
	done	
}

alias as3postdoc="as3postdoc-recursive"@

To run, @cd@ into the root directory of the Actionscript, and:

@as3postdoc .@
